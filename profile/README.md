🙌 Our mission is to provide young learners 👩‍🎓 with the best educational 📚 experience and be able to assist them in their journey 🚀 to accomplish their dreams in the future. OpenMirai is a Career-based educational platform based in Thailand 🇹🇭. The courses are made by either an individual or a team of content creators. These courses are available via a subscription service or a one-time purchase.

## 🧑‍💻 History of OpenMirai

- [OpenMirai](https://www.openmirai.com) was founded under the supervision of 5 people: Apiphoom Chuenchompoo, Pinsita Niam-in, Pawit Limpasuthum, Nopphasan Jeerawuttananont, and Pann Phetra. They were initially classmates 🏄 of [Panyapiwat Insitute of Management Demonstration School](https://satit.pim.ac.th) who had the same ideology; to create a learning environment where students work towards a dream career by learning from courses with real-world practicality. They formed the first-ever concept of this platform in the name ["Kyoiku"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyōiku_kanji) in August 2021. The idea consisted of a career-based education, where one would learn about the information required for their career and artificial intelligence that would assist a student in tracking 🛤 their progress throughout their journey from the start to the end. These concepts would then be reimagined in the form of Career-Based Learning, a system that would help students discover their true selves by routing their interests, focusing on one career that is right for them, and keeping track of the students progress as they move forward.

- In October 2021, Kyoiku was rebranded as OpenMirai due to difficulty 🤷‍♂️ when pronouncing the word. The ["Mirai"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirai_(given_name)) part of the name refers to the Japanese word for "future," hence the name "OpenMirai" means "Open Future." In addition, the name OpenMirai was proven to be more memorable 📸 for people to whom the team presented. Within the exact time period of the rebranding, OpenMirai Corporation has achieved its first recognition at the first official [Pitch@School Competition](https://www.pitchatschool.org), a competition where youths from across the country come together in order to pitch their idea for a startup company 🏢, hosted by the [Global Entrepreneurship Network (or known as GEN)](https://www.genglobal.org)

- As of March 2022, OpenMirai announced its first public beta test on the [UN International Day](https://www.un.org/en/observances/international-days-and-weeks) 🇺🇳 of Education and Pitch@School Awards Ceremony[5], hosted by [Panyapiwat Institute of Management University](http://www.pim.ac.th); the public was able to access the first few courses produced by the team and volunteer instructors under the OpenMirai brand.

## 📚 Career Paths and Special Mirai

Most of the courses are self-paced and can be fitted with activities by the creator.

### Special Mirai
